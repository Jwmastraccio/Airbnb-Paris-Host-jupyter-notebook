Introduction to the Analysis

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings in Paris to explore the impact of 2015 regulatory changes on the platform. The study focuses on three key areas:

Pricing trends across neighborhoods and accommodation sizes.
New host registration trends over time.
The effect of the 2015 regulations on the number of new hosts and average listing prices.
The analysis utilized advanced data manipulation and visualization techniques, creating actionable insights for Airbnb hosts and platform strategists. This detailed explanation highlights the methodology, insights, and conclusions.

Analysis Process
1. Data Exploration and Cleaning

Objective: Understand the dataset and ensure quality for analysis.
Steps Taken:
Imported the dataset and inspected its structure using .head() and .info().
Identified missing values, particularly in the host_since column (33 missing entries), and retained the dataset as it didnâ€™t affect high-level trends.
Filtered for Paris-specific listings using a query (city == 'Paris') and extracted relevant columns: host_since, neighbourhood, accommodates, and price.
2. Summary Statistics and Data Validation

Objective: Gain initial insights into price distributions and potential data quality issues.
Steps Taken:
Computed summary statistics to understand price ranges and accommodations.
Detected and reviewed anomalous entries (e.g., listings with price == 0 and accommodates == 0), ensuring they were excluded from visualizations.
3. Neighborhood Price Analysis

Objective: Assess price disparities across neighborhoods to identify premium and budget-friendly areas.
Steps Taken:
Grouped listings by neighbourhood and calculated the mean price.
Visualized the results using a horizontal bar chart, clearly showing price disparities.
Key Insights:
Premium neighborhoods like Elysee and Louvre commanded the highest prices, likely due to proximity to attractions and luxurious offerings.
Budget-friendly neighborhoods catered to cost-conscious travelers, creating a diverse market segmentation.
4. Price by Accommodation Capacity

Objective: Understand how group size impacts pricing strategies.
Steps Taken:
Focused on listings in Elysee, the most expensive neighborhood, and analyzed average prices based on accommodation capacity.
Grouped by accommodates and visualized using a bar chart.
Key Insights:
Listings with higher capacity (e.g., 3-4 beds) showed significantly higher prices, aligning with group travel demand.
Smaller accommodations (1-2 beds) remained competitively priced, targeting solo travelers and couples.
5. Trends Over Time

Objective: Investigate how the number of new hosts and average prices evolved over time, particularly post-2015.
Steps Taken:
Resampled data by year (host_since) to calculate:
The number of new hosts.
The average price of listings.
Created a dual-axis line chart showing new hosts (pink line) and average prices (secondary axis).
Key Insights:
New Hosts: A sharp decline in new hosts after 2015 indicates regulatory barriers limiting market entry.
Average Prices: A concurrent rise in prices suggests reduced supply may have driven demand for remaining listings, increasing prices.

Summary of Findings
Impact of Neighborhood on Pricing

High-demand neighborhoods like Elysee and Louvre cater to luxury travelers, commanding higher prices.
Budget-conscious travelers gravitate toward more affordable neighborhoods, which offer a competitive edge.
Accommodation Capacity and Pricing

Listings for larger groups show varied pricing strategies, likely reflecting value-for-money considerations.
Smaller accommodations dominate the budget traveler segment, showing consistent demand.
